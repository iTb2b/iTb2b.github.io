        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近买了一堆挂耳咖啡回来，因为没有条件现磨，也不想喝速溶，无意之中发现了这么个宝贝</p>
<p>撕开包装，浓郁的咖啡豆的香气塞满了我的鼻腔</p>
<p>将里面的小包取出，再撕开上部的封条</p>
<p>小包里装的是被磨成粉末的咖啡粉</p>
<p>把它挂在杯子上（没有咖啡杯）</p>
<p>量取 150ml 左右的热水，轻轻倒在表面</p>
<p>这一步，据懂行的说，叫<strong>闷蒸</strong></p>
<p>咱也不懂，照做就是</p>
<p>约莫等了大概 30s ，再分批、缓缓注入剩下的水</p>
<p>没有手冲壶，找了根细长的棒做引流</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gek2m228w9j308c07it8w.jpg" alt="这个就是手冲壶" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>拿着实验室学来的过滤引水的方法，让水淹没咖啡粉</p>
<p>在水下降到一半时，再次注入</p>
<p>听着滴滴答答液体下落的声音，嗅着不习惯的香气</p>
<p>有时还会忘记加水</p>
<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlly1gek2rk6ztrj30uu0u0kjl.jpg" alt="油脂浮在表面" style="zoom:50%;" />
<p>结束之后，扔掉没用的滤包，仅供使用一次</p>
<p>嘬一口，还行，不苦</p>
<p>再嘬一口，有点意思，有一种不是咖啡的味道</p>
<p>看看包装——“蓝山风味”</p>
<p>那就姑且把这种味道叫<strong>蓝山</strong>好了</p>
<p>尝尝咖啡也就是图个新鲜，或许也会喜欢上</p>
<p>但毕竟老是喝四十多的星巴克容易成为阶级敌人</p>
<p>当然，也容易成为我自己的敌人</p>
<p>挂耳还是方便，或许比不上手冲那么新鲜，但总比速溶来得健康</p>
<p>我喝不出什么花样，更喝不出“大师，我悟了”的感受</p>
<p>就是杯饮料，罢了</p>

<p><a href="https://qr.ae/pNr0OO">Quora</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you talk about RATE that means we are talking about how the physical quantity changes with time. For example: rate of change of displacement is called velocity.</p>
<p>In the same way if we are talking about gradient that means how the physical quantity varies with distance. For example : potential gradient gives you Vector field.</p>
<p>So in your case velocity gradient means how is the magnitude of velocity varies with distance. For example: when fluid is flowing through a pipe velocity of each layer is defined from the axis of cylindrical pipe. So velocity of fluid at axial point us max and if you move from axis to surface then velocity of the layer decreases .</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton’s concession speech 2016</p>
<p>CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Very rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.</p>
<p>Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I’m sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.</p>
<p>But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>I know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that’s hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.</p>
<p>We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.</p>
<p>Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don’t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Now — and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.</p>
<p>CLINTON: We’ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone — for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>So now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.</p>
<p>I am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>It has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>To Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>We — we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.</p>
<p>And to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most — even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom.</p>
<p>I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>You poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>And to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites…</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>… I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>To everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us.</p>
<p>And to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I’ve had successes and I’ve had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.</p>
<p>This loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>CLINTON: It is — it is worth it.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>And so we need — we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.</p>
<p>And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Now, I — I know — I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>And — and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Finally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>Because, you know — you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.”</p>
<p>So my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.</p>
<p>I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.</p>
<p>May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>最近在读的英语文章要不就是novel coronavirus要不就是东京奥运会，实在是没了兴致，于是翻着翻着找来了一篇乔布斯在斯坦福大学的演讲，此时他刚被查出癌症，经历了人生的turn events。三十分钟细读完毕，深受启发。</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="main-text">Main Text</h1>
<p>I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That’s it. No big deal. Just three stories.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-story-is-about-connecting-the-dots">The first story is about connecting the dots.</h2>
<p>I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?</p>
<p>It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.” My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.</p>
<p>And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents’ savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn’t see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn’t interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all romantic. I didn’t have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends’ rooms, I returned Coke bottles for the 5¢ deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:</p>
<p>Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating.</p>
<p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it’s likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.</p>
<p>Again, you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</p>
<h2 id="my-second-story-is-about-love-and-loss">My second story is about love and loss.</h2>
<p>I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.</p>
<p>I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down — that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me — I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.</p>
<p>I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</p>
<p>During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, <em>Toy Story</em>, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle.</p>
<h2 id="my-third-story-is-about-death">My third story is about death.</h2>
<p>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: <strong>“If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.”</strong> It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</p>
<p>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p>
<p>About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn’t even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor’s code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you’d have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.</p>
<p>I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and I’m fine now.</p>
<p>This was the closest I’ve been to facing death, and I hope it’s the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:</p>
<p>No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.</p>
<p>Your time is limited, so <strong>don’t waste it living someone else’s life</strong>. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. <strong>And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</strong></p>
<p>When I was young, there was an amazing publication called <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: It was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</p>
<p>Stewart and his team put out several issues of <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em>, and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</strong></em></p>
<p>Thank you all very much.</p>

<h2 id="git简介-安装">Git简介、安装</h2>
<p>分布式版本控制系统</p>
<p>macOS自带，故略</p>
<h2 id="版本库">版本库</h2>
<p>版本库是一个仓库(respository)，记录文件的修改删除，是文件<strong>历史</strong> 管理器</p>
<h3 id="创建目录">创建目录</h3>
<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir learngit
cd learngit
pwd
/Users/taocheung/Git/learngit

</code></pre>
<h3 id="初始化">初始化</h3>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/taocheung/Git/learngit/.git/
ls -a

</code></pre>
<p>告诉我这是一个空的仓库，查看了隐藏目录后发现有一个.git文件，勿动</p>
<h3 id="添加文件">添加文件</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>珍爱生命，远离巨硬</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="前提">前提</h4>
<p>Git只跟踪文本文件的改动，对于图片和视频这些二进制文件，只去追踪大小的改变。</p>
<p>Microsoft的word就是二进制格式，所以不要用Git去管理word，这是其一</p>
<p>其二，文本都是有编码的，中文常用GBK，建议使用UTF-8。Microsoft的文本文件，添加了十六进制字符，会出错。</p>
<h4 id="正文">正文</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>由于macOS的局限性，所以改创建一个markdown文件</p>
</blockquote>
<p>在<strong>learngit</strong>下创建一个文件<strong>readme.md</strong></p>
<p>添加内容</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Git is a version control system.

Git is free software.
</code></pre>
<p>之后提交文件</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git add readme.md
</code></pre>
<p>无任何显示</p>
<p>用<code>git commit</code>告诉Git，把文件提交到仓库</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git commit -m &quot;wrote a readme file&quot;
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 readme.md
</code></pre>
<p>表示一个文件被改动，插入了三行内容（我的光标在第三行）</p>
<h2 id="时光机穿梭">时光机穿梭</h2>
<p>现在修改文件</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Git is a distributed version control system.

Git is free software.
</code></pre>
<p>使用<code>Git status</code>查看结果，//查看状态</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   readme.md

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>在<strong>master</strong>分支，“changes”还没有被提交</p>
<p>如何查看修改了什么内容？<code>git diff</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">diff --git a/readme.md b/readme.md
index 8d7a2fb..14bbe9c 100644
--- a/readme.md

\ No newline at end of file
(END)
</code></pre>
<p>按q退出</p>
<p>知道了修改了什么之后再进行提交就放心了</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git add readme.md
</code></pre>
<p>在提交到仓库之前来看一下状态</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
	modified:   readme.md

<p><strong>Changes to be committed</strong>，改变即将被commit</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git commit -m &quot;add distributed&quot;
git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
</code></pre>
<p>再查看状态</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p><strong>working tree clean</strong></p>
<h3 id="工作区与暂存区">工作区与暂存区</h3>
<p>Git具有<strong>工作区</strong>和<strong>暂存区</strong>的概念</p>
<ul>
<li>工作区就是能看到的目录</li>
</ul>
<p>工作区有一个隐藏文件.git，是版本库</p>
<p>版本库里有很多东西，其中包括暂存区stage、分支master、指针HEAD</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="1"><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTly1gdp37zbjltj30cq06iaa8.jpg" alt="Git-repo，from 廖雪峰's blog" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>我们把文件往Git版本库里添加的时候，是分两步执行的：</p>
<ol>
<li>用<code>git add</code>把文件添加进去，实际上就是把文件修改添加到暂存区；</li>
<li>用<code>git commit</code>提交更改，实际上就是把暂存区的所有内容提交到当前分支。</li>
</ol>
<p>因为我们创建Git版本库时，Git自动为我们创建了唯一一个<code>master</code>分支，所以，现在，<code>git commit</code>就是往<code>master</code>分支上提交更改。</p>
<p>练习</p>
<p>增加一行内容</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software distributed under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
</code></pre>
<p>增加一个文件</p>
<p><strong>LICENSE.md</strong></p>
<p>查看状态</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   readme.md

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	LICENSE.md
</code></pre>
<p>Readme.md被修改，LICENSE.md未被tracked</p>
<p>使用命令<code>git add .</code>，全部添加</p>
<p>再次查看状态</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
	new file:   LICENSE.md
	modified:   readme.md
</code></pre>
<p>现在的暂存区</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="2"><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTly1gdp3l38emsj30cq06ijri.jpg" alt="Git 暂存区变动" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>使用commit 提交</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git commit -m &quot;understand how stage works&quot;
[master eeb0409] understand how stage works
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 LICENSE
</code></pre>
<p>此时工作区很干净</p>
<figure data-type="image" tabindex="3"><img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTly1gdp3ow0p65j30cv06iq32.jpg" alt="git-stage-after-commit" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>暂存区中没有内容了</p>

<p>Homebrew是macOS 下一款多功能的包管理工具，还能安装各种应用程序，方便管理</p>
<p>如pycharm，python，甚至是qq和微信</p>
<p><a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew官网</a></p>
<img src="https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/00831rSTly1gd8imyw3swj316i0sxtgf.jpg" alt="截屏2020-03-27下午3.25.27" style="zoom: 33%;" />
<p>在安装之前，我还寻思着为什么网上这么多避免“踩坑”的文章，不就是装个软件吗</p>
<p>现在想来，我真是太naive了😭</p>
<h2 id="安装">安装</h2>
<pre><code class="language-terminal">/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>这样……当然是不行的！中国可是全球最大的局域网，怎么可能就这么简单安装上了</p>
<p>事实上，如果按照官网给出的命令直接回车，下载速度是个位数，还时不时连接不上</p>
<p>这就是第一个坑了，怎么才能下载得快</p>
<p>经过网络的搜索，大致两个办法</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>端口代理</p>
<p>我采取了这个办法，并且成功了，下载速度有时在1M/s以上</p>
<p>首先输入</p>
<p><code>export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1087;export https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1087;</code></p>
<p>1087是本地代理端口号</p>
<p>无误后再按照官网输入安装命令</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>换源</p>
<p>虽然没有用到这个办法，但是为了以防万一，还是记录下来</p>
<p><code>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install &gt;&gt; Temp_Brew</code>  这个命令是把临时下载文件导出来</p>
<p><code>open Temp_Brew</code> 打开文件</p>
<p><code>BREW_REPO = &quot;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/homebrew/brew.git&quot;.freeze</code> 修改为清华源</p>
<blockquote>
<p>备用其他源，好像中科大用的人较多</p>
<p>阿里源：https://mirrors.aliyun.com/homebrew/brew.git<br>
USTC（中科大镜像）：https://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/brew.git</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>/usr/bin/ruby Temp_Brew</code> 保存后输入这一行代码，然后按提示即可</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Failed to connect to raw.githubusercontent.com port 443: Connection refused error:</code>  <s>重新打开一个terminal即可</s> 建议直接设置端口，这种情况一般是被墙了</p>

<h2 id="后记">后记</h2>
<p>意外发现cotilina自带了python3，那就不安装了，省的还要设置path</p>
<p>然后一直在那个设置了端口的终端跑命令，很快就下载完了pycharm-edu，一切都好用</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>抛去安装过程不谈（淘宝真香），macOS真是惊艳到我了</p>
<p>之前在少数派看到了一篇文章，<a href="https://sspai.com/post/58805">Unix设计哲学</a></p>
<p>其中的“文件概念”于我来说真是如救命稻草一般</p>
<p>我一直深受win的文件管理的毒害，无论怎么整理文件，到最后一定会变得一团糟</p>
<p>尤其是注册表，库之类的东西，删又删不干净</p>
<p>从小学起家里就有了电脑，当时就喜欢编程，再之后，有了苹果手机</p>
<p>那时起苹果的设计与交互方式就在潜移默化地影响着我</p>
<p>如今“<strong>极简</strong>”已经成为了我选择东西与行事方案的一条重要法则，说是生活态度也不为过</p>
<p>“<em>Give you what you want</em>”</p>
<p>一个程序你该干啥就干啥，别想整其他幺蛾子</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“中国的软件，始于创意，盛于设计，死于社交（约炮）”——我说的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>前几日运用“things 3” + “Forest” + &quot;Marginnote 3&quot; 的工作流程来学习，效率有很大很大的提高</p>
<p>别的不说，这三个应用的UI才是符合我的审美水平的</p>

<p>包括我现在写这篇文章，上传的图片都是在macOS下进行的<br>
<strong>typora</strong>+<strong>ipic</strong><br>
简单的几个按键就完成了图片上传和插入的过程，甚至在调教好后，把图片拖进来就能直接上传图片<br>
简单、快速、高效！</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我拖着行李，快步走向楼寓门，心扑通扑通地跳，我等不及电梯，三步并作两步，不停地向上攀爬。我等不及了！用锃亮的钥匙插入门锁，扭动，拉开，连行李都顾不上便冲入家中。<br>
空无一人。<br>
我仔细地环顾了一圈，确信没有人后，把行李拉了进去，轻轻地关上了门。我坐在沙发上，背靠着靠过无数次的软垫，不知该想些什么、做些什么。我在期待些什么，我不敢说，我不敢想，我害怕我的心愿不能成真，我害怕一切都是我的自以为是。<br>
“哈……”我把头向后靠了靠，舒展了刚才爬梯时不断奔跑的腿，抬起胳膊擦了擦头上的汗，但我的心始终放松不下来。<br>
“嘭！”是楼下大门关住的声音！<br>
我绷起了神经，刚放在膝盖上的手掌又急剧地出汗。寂静的家中除了我的呼吸声，还有墙外有人在爬楼梯的声音。这是我熟悉的步重、是我熟悉的频率……我站起身来，腿不听使唤地向门口迈去，心脏像加装了发动机一样跳跃。<br>
我大口大口地喘着气，脚仍在向前奔跑，余光一瞥，窗外刚刚下过雨的天空正在逐渐放晴，可这已经是傍晚了，晴天有什么用呢？<br>
在我刚刚到达门口的同时，锁被拧开，门外的人毫不犹豫地向我冲来，我张开双臂把她拥入怀中，低语道：<br>
“欢迎回来。”<br>
金色的余晖瞬间射入客厅，整间屋子像法式清汤一般澄澈。<br>
“我感到很疲倦，<br>
离家乡还是很远，<br>
害怕再也不能回到你身边。”<br>
这时，我才明白了这句歌词真正的意义。</p>
